<H2>A Prototype System of an Integrated RFID System.</H2>

<p>
To do the data verification, this is a prototype of an Tag Verifier, using an Arduino Component.

<br /><br />
<I>Requirement</I>
<br />
1. An Arduino Mainboard.<br />
2. A RFID/NFC Shield compatible with the Arduino Mainboard.<br />
<br />

This is a part of the source code of a Data Verification System of an Integrated RFID System.
This project is to deploy a demo system to test the Data Verification process.
